    <h2>Revision and Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      This semester has been an interesting one; that's for sure. This is my first year back to school since 2011,
      so it has been a change of pace for me. My fiancee tested and tried my webpages and more or less, 
      she said that she liked them. She didn't like my choice of color or the font, and I probably should have changed those.

      This class has taught me so much. Not just about the code, but about myself. I've always had an interesting
      in how websites and programs work. However, I always thought that it would be really difficult to get into without
      already knowing a programming language. With this class, I learned that it's really not that hard. All of the commands that 
      we've learned so far has made sense to me in a way that it's almost intantly memorized. I am excited to see what I can get into 
      with this as my career path and I am excited to actually be able to do something that I love.
