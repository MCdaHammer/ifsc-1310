      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p id="me"> My name is Mitch. I've always been interested in programming AI and things
      over the internet but am just now getting into it. I enjoy fishing, hunting, football, and video games; 
      not necessarily in that order. I also really enjoy 80's action movies. The Terminator movies
      were unparalleled in their use of cgi and other techniques to make those movies look so real for the time period
      that they were coming out.
      Technology is always evolving and we must evolve with it or risk being eliminated by it. 
      There is actually a very good clip in the 2009 movie "Terminator: Salvation" that touches on 
      that topic. Well, most of the Terminator movies are about exactly that (to the extreme); but this quote
      almost puts it into better words. You can find a link to the clip <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvGyS5j9aFY">here</a>.
      This has been an interesting year, as each one seems more interesting than the last,
      and I'm glad to be learning this now; with us being on the cusp of Web3. These are exciting times! 
      As Ferris Bueller once said on his infamous day off, "Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around
      once in a while, you could miss it."</p>
